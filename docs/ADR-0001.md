# 1. Proxy marker API direct to Honeycomb

Date: 2023-09-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We currently emit detailed telemetry from jobrunner using otel. Otel is
a standard, so use a standard otel-collector instance hosted at
collector.opensafely.org.

Honeycomb also supports [markers](https://docs.honeycomb.io/api/tag/Markers),
used to mark events such as deployments.  We want emit to markers from our
backends for events like deployments, image updates, or maintenance jobs.
Markers are not part of the otel standard, so we cannot proxy them via the
otel-collector.

## Decision

We will add a proxy stanza to the proxy for *just* the marker API. It will be easy to
extend to other Honeycomb APIs if needed.


## Consequences

We will be able to emit markers from the backend.

In theory, a compromised backend now has another channel to honeycomb to egress
data. But it already has a richer way to do so via otel anyway, so this doesn't change the 
risk doesn't change.
